# ALZHEIMER-S-DISEASE-STAGE-PREDICTION

# Overview
Alzheimer’s App is a deep learning–based web application that predicts the stage of Alzheimer’s disease from brain MRI scans. Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet), the app classifies images into stages such as Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Non-Demented. Users can upload MRI images and receive instant predictions through an intuitive web interface.

# Features
- Upload MRI brain scans for diagnosis
- Predict Alzheimer’s stage in real time
- Uses CNN and pretrained models (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet)
- Simple and responsive frontend
- Trained on Kaggle’s Alzheimer’s MRI dataset
- Flask or Streamlit backend for model integration
